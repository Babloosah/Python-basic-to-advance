we can use multiple tools to write and formate our pyhton code. Below are the list of different notebook which are free to use.
try practising your code on below Notebook.
  1. Jupyter (For R, Python)-open source notebook free to use
  2. zeppelin (for R, python, Scala)-open source notebook free to use
        best thing about appache zeppelin notebook is its ability to connect to different kernel in same note book. We can write a 
        block of code and execute in python and the execute next block of code in R.
  3. Spyder: This is  a complete software package free to use. We have to install annaconda with it. Annaconda provides command line prompt 
            for spyder. Different statisitcal, visualization package etc need to ne installed through annaconda.

once we are ready with any one of thr mentioned software, we can now begin our lesson.
